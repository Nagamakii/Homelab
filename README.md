  - 8-Port Gigabit GREENnet Switch, connects to all the Pis, (except the 3 B+). Great for low power consumption.

## Software

[Raspbian OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/)
  - I use this on all my Pis, it's lighter than most compatible OS's and makes setup for applications easy.

[PI-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/)
  - No special config, just running this on the Raspberry Pi 3 B+.
